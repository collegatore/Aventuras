/**
 * Tier 3 Selection
 *
 * The LLM selection step shared by `EntryRetrievalService` (lorebook entries) and
 * `WorldStateInjector` (live world state). Only the call itself is shared: how candidates
 * are built, and what cap and priority the result gets, stays with each caller.
 *
 * Both agree that nothing uncovered is silently dropped — each has a "small leftover"
 * branch that includes it without asking, and calls the model only for what is too big to
 * include. Both measure "too big" in words of candidate text, against their own
 * `tier3WholesaleWordBudget`; the budgets differ because their candidates do.

 * question of the same pool and get it phrased by different templates.
 *
 * Order matters because the answer is in index space — `"3"` means "the fourth candidate
 * in the list the prompt numbered". An order-independent key would resolve those indices
 * against a different ordering and name entirely different entries, which is reachable:
 * `WorldStateInjector` builds candidates from world state the classifier rewrites.
 *
 * The input matters because the answer is a judgement about a scene, not about the pool.
 * Keying on it means a reused answer is only ever reused for the same question — which is
 * what a retry or a second pass in the same turn asks — instead of answering a new action
 * with the previous one's verdict.
 *
 * The recent entries matter for exactly the same reason, and were missing. The prompt is
 * built from both, so keyed on the action alone two situations sharing a repeated action
 * ("continue", "wait") and an unmoved pool asked the same question as far as the cache
 * could see. Reachable across consecutive turns, and more easily still across a branch
 * switch, where two branches sit at the same position with the same lorebook and only
 * their history differs. Ids, not text: a slice of UUIDs is what distinguishes one history
 * from another, and translation rewrites the stored content without changing which entries
 * these are.
 *
 * With those in, the key is complete by content — the position window and the `clear` calls
 * are belt-and-braces rather than the thing standing between the cache and a wrong answer.
