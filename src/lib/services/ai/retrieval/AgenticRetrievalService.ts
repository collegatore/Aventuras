/**
 * Assemble the block the narrator receives, or `''` when there is nothing worth sending.
 *
 * Split out of `runRetrieval` because it is the one part of the run whose rules are worth
 * pinning and the only one testable without an agent: everything above it needs a provider,
 * a prompt pack and the debug store.
 *
 * **Nothing gathered means an empty context, not a context containing an apology** -- but
 * "nothing gathered" is not the same as "chapterSummary is empty". That field is optional in
 * `finish_retrieval`'s schema, and a run that puts its findings in `synthesis` instead is a
 * normal outcome, so keying the whole result off `chapterSummary` threw away completed work
 * whenever the model made that choice. What has to be suppressed is narrower: a run that did
 * not reach `finish_retrieval` and salvaged nothing, whose only output would be a note about
 * the retrieval agent's own troubles -- which the narrator reads as story material. Hence
 * `reachedFinish`: a truncated run needs real findings to be worth reporting, a finished one
 * is reported on whatever it produced.
 *
 * **One heading, because this is one block.** The two label conventions in this codebase are
 * structural, not stylistic: `[BRACKETS]` is a top-level block of the narrator's prompt
 * (`MemoryService.buildRelevantContextBlock`), `##` is a markdown subsection inside one
 * (`buildChapterSummariesBlock`, which sits within `<story_history>` beside the chapter
 * summaries). This block is top-level, so it takes the bracket form. Emitting both -- as this
 * did -- gave the block a subsection carrying its own name, which reads as two separate
 * pieces of retrieved context rather than one.
 *
 * `reasoning` and `chapterContext` stay two paragraphs rather than two headings: the prompt
 * already tells the agent they are a sentence of framing and the material itself, and on a
 * salvaged run the first is literally "raw findings below".
