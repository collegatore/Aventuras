 *
 * Version history:
 * - v1.0.0 Initial release
 * - v1.1.0 Added lorebookEntries
 * - v1.2.0 Added styleReviewState
 * - v1.3.0 Added timeTracker to story, entry metadata (timeStart/timeEnd)
 * - v1.4.0 Added embeddedImages (generated images embedded in story entries)
 * - v1.5.0 Added character portraits
 * - v1.6.0 Added checkpoints and branches
 * - v1.7.0 Added chapters (memory system)
 * - v1.8.0 Added currentBgImage (carried on the story record)
 * - v1.9.0 Added packBinding (prompt pack identity, the story's variable answers, and the
 *          pack's variable definitions — never its template content)
 * - v1.10.0 Added timeAnchors (the in-story times the reader asserts entries ended at).
 *          Deliberately absent from `FEATURE_HISTORY`: a story that carries no anchors is the
 *          normal state, not a feature the file lost, so an older file has nothing to warn about.
