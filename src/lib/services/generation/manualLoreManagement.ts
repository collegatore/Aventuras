 * lock is what all three callers pass through, and it is authoritative where
 * `ui.loreManagementActive` is not: that flag lingers for two seconds after a run so the
 * user can read the summary.
 *
 * **It never rejects.** Both callers are fire-and-forget — a button's `onclick` and the
 * step after a manual chapter — so a rejection here has nowhere to go but the console, as
 * an unhandled one. Reporting null is the same answer they already handle.
 *
 * @param newChapter The chapter just created by hand, if this run follows one. Given to the
 * agent in full; absent for the Tidy lorebook button, which has no new chapter.
