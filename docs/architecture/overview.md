## Panels and gestures

Two panels flank the story: the world sidebar on the right (`Sidebar.svelte`) and the story
navigation panel on the left (`StoryNavPanel.svelte`). Each opens with a swipe away from its own
edge, and that same direction then keeps carrying the reader further in, while its opposite walks
back out and finally closes the panel.

| Panel                   | Opens with  | Next tab    | Back, then closes |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| World sidebar (right)   | swipe left  | swipe left  | swipe right       |
| Navigation panel (left) | swipe right | swipe right | swipe left        |

One consequence is easy to undo by accident: **each tab strip is ordered so that the tab nearest
the story is its default and the one a further outward swipe closes from.** The sidebar runs
Characters -> Branches left to right and starts on Characters; the navigation panel runs Timeline ->
Navigation and starts on Navigation. Reversing either list, or moving a tab into it at the wrong
end, leaves the opening swipe with nowhere to go and puts the close on the wrong tab.

Only the _first_ opening uses that default. Both panels keep their current tab in `ui.svelte.ts`
(`sidebarTab`, `navPanelTab`) rather than in the component, so closing and reopening returns the
reader to where they were. Holding it in the panel would reset it on every mount, which reads as
the panel forgetting what you were doing.

## Edge swipes

The edge swipes that open the two side panels live in `AppShell.svelte` and are deliberately
asymmetric. The right one opens the sidebar whenever it is closed; the left one only while
_neither_ panel is open, because a right-swipe inside the open sidebar already belongs to that
sidebar's tab strip and must not also open the panel behind it.

They are read off the shell itself, counting only gestures that _start_ within 30px of an edge (20px
above the mobile breakpoint), not from invisible strips over the page. A strip takes every tap that
lands on it, and on a phone the outer halves of the header's panel button and of Send sit within
that band. A gesture that starts in a text field is never a swipe, so placing a caret or selecting
text in the action input cannot open a panel. Because swipes inside a panel bubble up to the shell, a panel must never reach the
opposite edge's band. On a phone neither does: the sidebar is capped at 288px and the navigation
panel at `100vw - 3rem`.

## Drawer swipes, and the one place we reach into `vaul`

A drawer that holds unsaved work has to answer a swipe with a question rather than a close, and
`vaul` offers no veto: it decides inside its own release handler. `createDrawerSwipeGuard`
(`ui/drawer/swipe-guard.ts`) takes the one seam there is — `vaul` calls the content's
`onpointerup` just before it measures the swipe — and, when the caller says the drawer is dirty,
puts the sheet back at rest so that measurement finds nothing to act on, then animates the settle
itself.

**On upgrading `vaul-svelte`**, check three things against the new version, because the guard
copies them rather than importing them (they are internal):

- the release callback still runs before the swipe is measured (`use-drawer-content.svelte.js`),
- `VELOCITY_THRESHOLD` and the settle transition in `internal/constants.js`, mirrored in the
  guard, and
- `closeThreshold`, which the guard reads from `DRAWER_CLOSE_THRESHOLD` and `drawer.svelte`
  passes to `vaul`; the two must stay one constant.

If the seam closes, the fallback still holds: a dirty drawer that closes anyway comes back as a
fresh sheet once the old one has released its scroll lock — slower, but not broken.

Two other `vaul` behaviours the callers have to know: it closes a non-dismissible drawer when its
handle is tapped, and a close driven from our side never reaches its restore, so the scroll lock
is released by hand (see `utils/scrollLock`).

## The soft keyboard

`MainActivity` calls `enableEdgeToEdge()`, which sets `decorFitsSystemWindows = false` and with it
gives up the window resizing `adjustResize` would otherwise do on API 30 and later. Nothing then
shortens the WebView when the keyboard opens, and Chromium is not told either: `innerHeight` and
`visualViewport.height` both stay at the full screen, so the keyboard simply covers whatever was
under it, the focused field included.

So `onWebViewCreate` takes the `ime()` inset for itself and sets it as the WebView's bottom
margin. That shortens the laid-out view, so the layout viewport is shorter, so `vh`, `dvh` and
every fixed surface end at the keyboard instead of running under it. The margin is load-bearing
and padding is not a substitute: a padded WebView keeps its measured height and the page never
relayouts. Below API 30 the window still resizes on its own, the decor consumes the inset before
it reaches the WebView, and the margin stays at zero; `SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_RESIZE` is set
explicitly so that path does not resolve to panning.

`AndroidBridge.getInsets()` reports the bottom inset net of the keyboard. With the keyboard up the
navigation bar is underneath it and the view already ends at its top edge, so `--sab` goes to zero;
otherwise every surface padded by `--safe-bottom` keeps a bar-height strip of background above the
keyboard. `app.html` refreshes the variables on `resize`, which the margin change fires.

Keyboard geometry has that one owner. Nothing in the page listens to `visualViewport`, and the
bottom drawer's own `repositionInputs` is switched off in `ui/drawer` on Android: it measures the
keyboard as the difference between `innerHeight` and the visual viewport, which there is now always
zero. Elsewhere it stays on, since nothing else shrinks the layout viewport for the keyboard.

The page cannot fix this from its own side. `interactive-widget=resizes-content` in the viewport
meta asks the _browser_ to shrink the layout viewport, and in an embedded WebView that resize can
only come from the embedder's window, which edge-to-edge has opted out of. It was tried, and
changed nothing.

## Focus inside a long dialog

`Dialog.Content` traps focus, and the trap has one fallback: when the element holding focus is
removed from the DOM, it focuses the first tabbable element in the dialog. A long editing dialog
removes focused elements all the time (a card folds, a Clear button vanishes, an overlay's Back
button unmounts), and a fallback that lands on a control at the top scrolls the whole surface up
to it. `TimelineReconciliationModal.svelte` is the worked case.

The rule that makes this a non-problem rather than a list of cases: **the dialog's scroll region
is its first tabbable element** (`tabindex="0"`, `role="region"`), sized to the viewport rather
than to its content. Every fallback then lands on a container already in view, and focusing it
does not scroll. Two things keep that true, and both are structural:

- nothing tabbable is placed before the region in DOM order — in the narrow layout that means
  the title strip above it, in the wide layout the region already wraps the title;
- the region keeps its `min-h-0 flex-1` sizing, so it never grows past the viewport.

`holdFocus` calls remain where a card is about to disappear under an open soft keyboard, so the
keyboard closes before the card does; they are no longer what stops the scroll.

## One way out of a dialog

A dialog has exactly one dismiss control: either the header's X or a Cancel button, never both.
Two controls that do the same thing make the reader wonder how they differ, and a Cancel beside a
confirming action is the clearer of the two wherever the dialog asks for a decision. Such a dialog
passes `closeButton={false}` to `ResponsiveModal.Header`; the X stays for dialogs that only show
something and have no action to cancel.

## Data Model

The story is an append-only list of `StoryEntry` rows (`user_action`, `narration`, `system`),
each carrying a `position` and a `branchId`. Almost everything else hangs off that list:

- **Branches** fork at a `forkEntryId`. `story.entries` is the current branch's view, assembled
  from the branch's own rows plus everything inherited from its ancestors; `visibleEntries` is
  that list minus what has been folded into chapters.

  **Editing an entry from before a fork changes that entry for every branch below it — but only
  its text.** Say a branch was forked at entry 30, and entry 12 is then rewritten. Entries are one
  set of rows that branches point into, never copies, so the new branch shows the new wording
  immediately. What it does _not_ show is any consequence of the rewrite: the world state it was
  given when it forked, the per-entry `worldStateDelta` a rollback would restore, and the clock
  stored on the fork's checkpoint were all derived from the old text and are left as they were. So
  the branch can be reading a passage that no longer mentions a knife while its world state still
  holds one. Nothing detects or reports this.

  `updateEntry` guards the wrong thing here. Its one rule is that the entry must belong to the
  branch you are on, which allows the rewrite above (entry 12 belongs to the branch you are
  standing on) and refuses the reverse case, where you stand on the new branch and edit entry 12
  — the edit that would have had the same effect, from the branch that cares about it. That is
  known, and left alone until we decide what editing shared history should mean.

- **Entry numbers** are what a reader sees and types: `position + 1`, every entry type counted,
  so the last entry's number equals the branch's entry count. Numbering is per branch view — a
  branch continues its parent's positions from the fork, so shared history keeps its numbers and
  sibling branches reuse them after the fork. `resolveEntryByNumber` (`utils/storyNavigation.ts`)
  floors to the nearest lower entry, which is what makes a gap left by an import or a reconciliation
  navigable rather than a dead number.
- **Chapters** cover a contiguous run of entries (`startEntryId`/`endEntryId`) and replace them
  in the prompt with a summary. Entries after the last chapter's end are the **un-chapterized
  tail** (`story.getUnchapterizedEntries()`) — the newest material, and the part chapter-oriented
  tools would otherwise be blind to.

  The story view can mark them with banners (`showChapterBanners`, off by default).
  `buildChapterBanners` (`utils/chapterBanners.ts`) places one before each chapter's first entry
  and one before the tail, from `currentBranchChapters`. A chapter needs both its ends in the
  loaded entries, as `getChapterEntries` does, and the tail begins where
  `getUnchapterizedEntries` says it does (`lastResolvedChapterEnd`), so the two cannot disagree.
  The tail banner and its navigation row are unnumbered — the tail is not a chapter yet — and read
  "The Story Continues". Banners link to their neighbours in story order, not `number` order,
  which can disagree after a branch switch. A banner renders inside its entry's `data-entry-id`
  wrapper, so every jump to that entry lands on the banner above it.

  The navigation panel lists the same chapter starts as landmarks whether or not banners are
  shown; with them off, the jump lands on the chapter's first entry. A chapter or tail row
  never switches branch in "Switch to checkpoint branch" mode: its start can lie in an ancestor's
  history while the chapter is in the current branch's view all the same.

  A jump lifts the view so the entry above the landing shows, whole when it is within 30% of the
  viewport and clipped at that height when it is taller, with half the gap between cards as the
  margin above it, so the card before it stays out of view (`contextLift`). Its kind does not change the rule.

  The list also carries a **First entry** row on the branch's first entry and a **Last entry** row
  on its last (one row, First entry, when there is a single entry). Both stay on the current
  branch in every navigation mode. The list's filter has two remembered options: one hides or shows
  those two rows (`nav_show_first_last`), the other the chapter rows and the tail row together
  (`nav_show_chapters`), and a third hides or shows the checkpoint rows together with the origin
  row of a branch, which is named after its fork checkpoint (`nav_show_checkpoints`). The orphaned
  checkpoints section is not filtered: it is where they are cleared out.

- **World state** (`Character`/`Location`/`Item`/`StoryBeat`) is rewritten by the classifier after
  every turn. A lorebook `Entry` carries no live state of its own: the type has `state` fields
  per entry type, but every creation path initialised them blank and nothing ever wrote one
  (0 of 16 character entries on a measured 41-chapter save), so the four Tier 1 conditions that
  read them never fired and are gone. Presence is `WorldStateInjector`'s claim to make. The
  never-produced `mentionCount`/`firstMentioned`/`lastMentioned` are gone from the model too;
  their columns stay, with their defaults. It is _not_ the Lorebook: `Entry[]` records are
  authored lore that changes only when someone edits them. The two pools never overlap, and
  two different services inject them.

  **A rendered entity line must never be re-readable as a name.** The classifier is shown
  the entities that already exist and writes names back, so `- Eira (claimed as a consort)
[inactive]` came back as the name, missed `sameEntityName`, and created a second
  character — four of thirty-eight on a measured 41-chapter save, two carrying the
  subject's own `relationship` verbatim. Name and attributes are now separate lines
  (`relationship:`, `status:`, `appearance:`), in every list `ClassifierService` renders —
  characters, locations, items, story beats — and in `WorldStateInjector`'s narrator block,
  whose prose the classifier also reads. One name per line also holds names a
  comma-separated list could not: locations and items were CSV until they carried state.

  **State reaches the classifier only where it can act on it.** `appearance:` goes with a
  character in the scene, `description:` with the current location, and an item's
  `quantity`/`equipped`/`location` only when they differ from the default — because each of
  those is a whole-value replacement, and a model cannot rewrite what it was not shown. The
  same rule sizes the prompt: on a large cast the omitted halves are most of it.

  **`scene.currentLocationName` is the only thing that moves the scene.** It creates the
  location if the name is new, marks it `current` and `visited`, and clears the previous
  one. `locationUpdates.changes.current` and `newLocations[].current` did the same job from
  two other places, applied in an order the model could not see, so a response naming two
  places kept whichever ran last — and the merge path set a second `current` without
  clearing the first. Both are gone from the schema.

  **Presence is reported, departure is inferred.** The classifier answers one question about the
  cast — `scene.presentCharacterNames`, every _other_ character in the scene at the end of the
  passage; the protagonist is in every scene by definition and is added by the consumers — and
  `resolveCharacterPresence` (`services/generation/characterPresence.ts`) turns the complement into
  `inactive`. Asking a model to name thirty absent characters produces nothing; asking it to name
  the three in front of it is the question the passage answers. The inference is refused whenever
  the list carries no signal: a salvaged or failed classification, or an empty array — which the
  schema defaults, so "the model said nobody" and "the model did not answer" arrive identically.
  `characterUpdates.status` stays for what the scene states outright, `deceased` above all, and
  wins over the inference. `appearance:` is sent to the classifier only for characters in the
  scene, and the template forbids rewriting an appearance it was not shown, so a returning
  character keeps the descriptors it accumulated.

- **State Tracking** (Labs) records every world and lorebook change in `world_state_changes`,
  which is what makes retry, time-travel delete and regenerate reversible (`rollbackService`) and
  lets a checkpoint be rebuilt at a past entry. Older entries keep a per-entry `worldStateDelta`.
  See [state-tracking.md](state-tracking.md).
- **Checkpoints** are full state snapshots; **retry backups** are in-memory only and do not
  survive an app restart or a story switch. A checkpoint is anchored to its `lastEntryId` and is
  deleted with that entry - in the same transaction, alongside the chapters and embedded images
  that reference it. It is the fork point a branch would be created from, so an orphaned one
  yields a branch pointing at an entry the database no longer holds. A reader may delete a
  checkpoint directly only until it is used to create a branch; the persistence delete repeats
  that check so stale UI state cannot clear the branch's origin.

  **A checkpoint has no branch column**: it is owned by the branch of the entry it is anchored to,
  which `getCheckpoints` resolves through a LEFT JOIN on `story_entries` and hands to the store as
  `branchId` plus `anchored`. The join is a left one because a checkpoint whose anchor is gone is
  still worth showing - `anchored: false` is what the navigation panel lists as orphaned, and it is
  the only thing distinguishing that from a checkpoint that merely belongs to another branch, since
  both are absent from the loaded entries. Deleting a branch selects its checkpoints by the same
  rule, as a subquery inside the deletion transaction rather than from ids the store supplies, so
  cleanup does not depend on the store's list being complete.

  The store therefore loads every column **except `entries_snapshot`**, which copies the story up
  to that point and so outweighs the story itself several times over once every checkpoint holds
  one. Export, sync and backup take the whole row through `getCheckpointRecords`; the two shapes
  are `Checkpoint` and `CheckpointRecord`, and the split is what stops an export quietly shipping
  without the snapshots an import expects. A retry backup is scoped to
  a **branch** as well as a story: it records the branch it was taken on, is offered only there,
  and is refused on any other. Positions are reused by sibling branches after a fork, so a
  snapshot applied to the wrong branch deletes rows that merely share a number - and the
  world-state restore deletes the active branch's rows and **re-inserts only the snapshot rows
  belonging to that branch**. The delete is branch-scoped, so the insert has to be: a snapshot
  taken on a branch that resolves its world state through the lineage carries ancestor rows too,
  with their own `branch_id`, which the delete never touched. Re-inserting one collides on the
  primary key — and since these statements cannot share a transaction (see
  [persistence.md](persistence.md)), the deletes have already committed by then, so the branch
  loses its entries _and_ its own world state and the restore dies with nothing put back.
  Filtering makes the two halves symmetric whatever shape the branch is, which matters because
  `snapshot_complete` no longer reliably says which shape that is. An override the undone
  generation created is absent from the snapshot, so it is deleted and not restored — correct,
  because the inherited row it stood in for shows through again.

  That the branch ends up with nothing is not an experimental-settings matter: the per-branch
  entity queries match `branch_id` exactly and never fall back to inherited rows, main included
  when the snapshot came from a branch. Lightweight branches only decide how total it is — a
  pre-snapshot COW branch still resolves its ancestors' entities, while snapshot isolation and
  the legacy per-branch load both leave the panels empty.

- **Removing an entry a branch forks from is refused**, and the check runs before anything else
  the operation would rewind - a rollback, or the lorebook activation a retry restores - because
  a refusal raised afterwards would leave that half applied. Editing and deleting are refused the
  same way while a generation or a retry restore is running: the store throws, and the caller is
  expected to say so rather than treat the untouched story as a completed edit. **Switching
  branches is refused on the same grounds**, for as long as a generation holds the branch.

## Generation Pipeline

A narrator turn is a sequence of phases under `src/lib/services/generation/phases/`, each an async
generator that yields typed events and returns a result. Dependencies are injected, which is what makes
them testable without a provider.

`Retrieval → Narrative → Classification → Translation → Image / BackgroundImage → PostGeneration`, with
`PreGeneration` preparing the retry backup first.

Only the narrative phase is fatal on failure — there is no turn without a narration. Every other phase
degrades: a failed classification leaves world state untouched, a failed translation keeps the original
text, failed images leave the entry without one.

`RetrievalPhase` runs in two stages on purpose. Stage A (world state + lorebook selection) must finish
before stage B (memory retrieval), because the memory step is told what the narrator's prompt already
contains, and a _partial_ list of that is worse than none — it is read as a statement, so naming half of
it invites work on the other half.

Phases are wired by `GenerationPipeline`, but the dependency objects are built in
`src/lib/components/story/ActionInput.svelte` (`buildPipelineDependencies`). That is where the
store, the settings and `aiService` are bound together; the phases themselves import none of them,
which is what keeps them testable.

Alongside the pipeline, `BackgroundTaskRunner` handles what happens _after_ a turn — the chapter
threshold check, lore management and the style review — on its own dependency object.

### The generation lease

A generation is bound to the branch it started on, by a lease the initiating handler takes before
its first read or write and gives up after its last one. There are four such handlers, all in
`ActionInput.svelte`: `handleSubmit`, `handleRetryLastMessage`, `handleRegenerateNarration` and
`handleRetry`. `generateResponse` takes the lease as a required parameter, so a fifth cannot be
added without acquiring one.

Leaving the story is refused for the same reason, and so is opening another one: the
classification that follows a narration writes through whatever story and branch are live, so
swapping either out from under a generation sends its remaining writes to the wrong place. The
Library button and the Android back press both report the refusal rather than navigating.

The lease and a branch switch are mutually exclusive in both directions: acquiring is refused while
a switch is queued but unsettled, and `performBranchSwitch` refuses while a lease is held. That
second check sits inside the queued body rather than at `switchBranch`'s entrance, because a switch
accepted while idle reaches the front of the queue _after_ a generation may have begun.

Two moments are distinct. **Drained** is when the turn's own writes have settled; **finished**
is when a rewind deferred by Stop has run too, and only then is the branch given up.

The lease does **not** cover the post-turn background tasks — chapter creation and lore
management are started un-awaited and outlive it. Lore management refuses a write whose branch
has moved (`loreCallbacks.assertScope`); chapter creation does not, so a chapter finished after
a switch takes its number from the branch now loaded. The row still carries the right branch,
so this is a numbering fault rather than a misplaced chapter. Analyzed images outlive it too; a
generated portrait is saved only if its story and branch are still open and the character has no
portrait yet (`story.saveGeneratedPortrait`), and the write — including any copy-on-write
override — lands on the captured branch and reaches the in-memory list only while that branch is
still the open one. Stop registers
its rewind on the lease and waits for it rather than releasing — aborting the request to the model
is not the completion of the generation's writes, and an `applyClassificationResult` already entered
keeps going regardless. One release owner throughout, so the rewind cannot race the writes it
exists to reverse. Once the narration is saved, Stop is refused outright — the button dims and a tap
explains — since nothing after the narration observes the abort. "Generate a different response"
refuses it throughout, as its own rewind of the previous turn is already running.

**Why the switch is refused rather than the writes redirected.** `applyClassificationResult` reads
the active branch and mutates the in-memory `characters`/`locations`/`items`/`storyBeats` arrays,
which hold _that_ branch's view. Pointing it at another branch means decoupling "the branch being
written" from "the branch loaded in memory" — an architectural change, not a parameter. Redirecting
only the entries would be worse than redirecting nothing: the narration would land on the branch
that asked for it while the classification accounting for it did not, leaving that branch holding an
entry its world state does not know about.

**When the restriction can be lifted.** This covers the story guard too — it is the same
stand-in, for the same reason. Once world-state application takes the branch to write to as
an argument instead of reading the active one, **and** `addEntry` redirects to the bound branch
rather than asserting against it. Both, not either — the entry half alone produces exactly the
mismatch described above. Branch-scoping `isGenerating`, so Stop and the streaming placeholder
follow the generating branch, belongs to that work too; while the restriction stands the reader
cannot reach another branch to see them. `addEntry`'s assertion is the tripwire in the meantime: if
the exclusion is ever holed, a write lands as a thrown error rather than as a row on the wrong
branch.

### Activity reporting

A turn records what it is doing as a tree of timed steps, so the wait before the first token is
readable rather than a three-dot animation. `services/activity/` holds the record and the reading
views over it — nesting, the deepest running step, durations, retention — all plain TypeScript;
`stores/activity.svelte.ts` is the reactive shell.

The phases reach it through an `ActivityReporter` on `PipelineDependencies`, bound in
`buildPipelineDependencies` alongside everything else. They do not import the store: that is the same
rule that keeps them testable without a provider, and `NO_ACTIVITY` stands in wherever no reporter was
injected. Services under `services/ai/` write to the store directly instead, following the debug
store's precedent — their tests mock it the same way.

Nesting is by explicit parent id, threaded through the options objects that already reach those
services (`activityParentId`). An implicit stack would not survive Stage A's two concurrent branches
or the parallel post-narrative phases.

Retrieval reports through the record it already keeps: `retrievalSteps.ts` translates `RetrievalEvent`
into steps as `AgenticRetrievalService` records them, and chapter queries carry the `durationMs` the
budget already measured. Phases with several completion paths are wrapped by `trackPhase` rather than
instrumented one exit at a time.

Each request is its own step, opened by the caller that knows what it is for and passed down as
`activityParentId`. Below that, `sdk/generate.ts` puts `activityMiddleware` directly inside
`retryOn429Middleware`: a request that needs a second attempt gets one step per attempt (the first
backfilled) and one per wait the retry middleware schedules. The SDK's own retries re-enter the
chain and show as attempts; the waits between them are the library's and are not reported. The
retrieval agent builds its model elsewhere (`sdk/agents/factory.ts`) and has no attempt rows.

A failed step carries its reason, worded once by `describeActivityError` (status and provider
message for an API error). Services that absorb a failure into a fallback — translation,
suggestions, action choices, timeline fill, scene analysis, the background image, the classifier's
`_error` — return the fallback as before, with the reason as `failure`. Whoever opened the step
closes it: `trackStep` fails a step on a returned `failure` as on a throw. A service closes only
the steps it opened itself. A cancellation is never absorbed: the `AbortError` is rethrown
(`isAbortError`), and whoever catches it closes the step as skipped.
A turn ends with an outcome (`turnOutcome`): only `halted` puts "Failed" on the collapsed line, and
a turn halts only when it produced no narration. A narrator stream that fails after text has arrived
keeps that text as the narration and reports the failure; one that fails before any text is passed
again, like an empty answer, unless the request itself was refused.

The narrator's empty-answer loop reports _passes_, kept apart from the transport _attempts_ inside
them: a single pass has no container, and is grouped into `Pass 1` (`groupChildren`) only once a
second follows. An empty pass is a failure. The work the consumer does with a phase's result —
`Updating world`, `Saving translation` — is a step the consumer opens around that work. A phase
switched off in settings is not reported at all; one switched on but missing its profile is struck
through with that reason. A step recorded after the fact without a duration (`untimed`) shows no
time rather than `0s`.

Reporting never alters a turn. Every write is guarded, the display sits inside a boundary, and the
narrative retry loop is reported but unchanged. Records are session-only, bounded by `RETAINED_TURNS`,
and never persisted or exported.

`activityReporting` defaults to `line`, so an install that has never touched the setting reports the
running step rather than the ellipsis. `activity_reporting` is written only by `setActivityReporting`
and the interface reset, so a stored `off` is a choice and is read back as one — the default reaches
absent keys only.

A turn's timeline opens by default while it is the latest turn in `tree` mode, and in either
mode for any turn in which a step failed, a recovered attempt included. A reader's own choice wins.

## Images

Nine backends live under `src/lib/services/ai/image/providers/` — NanoGPT, OpenAI, OpenRouter,
Google, Chutes, Zhipu, Pollinations, plus local ComfyUI (workflow-based) and A1111.

Resolution is chosen as an **intent** — orientation (1:1 / 16:9 / 9:16) plus one of four size
steps — and each adapter turns it into what its backend accepts: an aspect ratio for Google and
OpenRouter, the model's own published resolution list for NanoGPT, real dimensions for
ComfyUI/A1111/Pollinations (`src/lib/utils/image.ts`). A backend that is handed pixel dimensions
it does not offer answers with the nearest thing it does, which is not the same picture.

Images are stored as base64 in SQLite. Export and import of a story with images (`.avt`) is
handled natively in Rust so the payloads never enter the WebView heap — see
[persistence.md](persistence.md).

### Local image servers on iOS

App Transport Security blocks the WebView's `fetch` to plaintext `http://` hosts outside the
local-network exception, and it does so silently. Local backends therefore make every HTTP call
through Tauri's HTTP plugin (`imageGetFetch`, or the patched `fetchApi` for ComfyUI, whose SDK
has no injection point), on every platform. `comfy.test.ts` fails if an SDK upgrade renames the
members that patch replaces.

The ComfyUI SDK also holds a WebSocket, and `CallWrapper` only finishes on events from it, so the
socket goes through `tauri-plugin-websocket` too (`tauriWebSocket.ts`, passed as
`customWebSocketImpl`); the WebView's own `ws://` is subject to the same ATS block.

## Environment

There are no required `.env` files for local development or the built app:

- `import.meta.env.DEV` is set automatically by Vite and only gates debug logging
  (`src/lib/log.ts`) — nothing to configure.
- **API Keys**: for AI providers, configured at runtime via the UI (Settings -> API Settings), not via
  environment variables.
- Android builds read `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`), `NDK_HOME`, and `JAVA_HOME` from the shell
  environment. `scripts/android-setup.sh` and `compileApk.sh` will auto-detect these from common install
  locations if unset.
