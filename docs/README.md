# Aventuras — internal documentation

How the app is put together and why it is put together that way. The user-facing page is
the [repository README](../README.md); this is for whoever is changing the code.

These documents carry the reasoning that does not fit in a comment: the measured numbers,
the failure a design exists to prevent, the two things that must stay in step. Code
comments stay short and say only what the next reader cannot infer — see
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Keeping them true

If a change alters behaviour a document describes, update the document in the same commit.
A document nobody trusts costs more than no document: the numbers in these files were
measured, and a stale one is read as a measurement.
